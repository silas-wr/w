A logging program for any project.

My goal for this project is to be able to generate logs for any project in all (or most) languages.
The only thing you need is a `.w` file with the name of your project, and from then on, you can just add the directories you want.
If you need specific settings for a specific directory, you create a custom `directory.w` file in that directory, 
  which in turn connects to the main project
