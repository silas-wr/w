## Add your folder

If you want to add a new programming language, make a new fork of this project, add a folder with the name of the programming language in the root folder, and make your
changes.

For example, if there are two languages, `java` and `python`

```
==============================================================
java/
|---- ...
python/
|---- ...
==============================================================
```

you can add programming language `weird` to your pull request.

```
==============================================================
java/
|---- ...
python/
|---- ...
weird/
|---- ...
==============================================================
```

## Notes

I advise you to add tests in the programming langauge. This isn't required, but if I want to check that everything is fine, I might want to see some tests.
I will not accept a programming language that doesn't exist, is in development and is not finished, or a language that won't be used very much.
For example, I will probably NOT accept the `weird` language, even if it is a language. It just doesn't make much sense.
But even if I don't, I will thank you for at least trying. ðŸ™‚
